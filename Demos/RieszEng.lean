# An introduction to Lean via Riesz' Theorem

I will explain the proof of Riesz' Theorem to the computer.

This theorem asserts that if a real normed vector space has a compact ball, then the space
is finite-dimensional.

We prove the contrapositive: if the space is not finite-dimensional, we will construct
a sequence in the ball of radius `2` whose points are all at distance at least `1`,
contradicting the compactness of the ball.

We construct the sequence by induction. Assume that the first `n` points `xᵢ`
have been constructed. They span a subspace `F` which is finite-dimensional and
therefore complete (by equivalence of norms), hence closed. Let `x ∉ F`. Denote by `d`
its distance to `F` (which is positive by closedness). Let us choose `y ∈ F`
with `dist x y < 2 d`. I claim that `d⁻¹ * (x - y)` can be chosen as the next point
of the sequence. Its norm is indeed at most `2`. Moreover, as `x∩ ∈ F`, we
have `y + d * xᵢ ∈ F`. Therefore,
`d ≤ dist x (y + d * xᵢ)`, i.e., `d ≤ ‖d * (d⁻¹ * (x - y) - xᵢ)‖`,
which gives `1 ≤ ‖d⁻¹ * (x - y) - xᵢ‖` as claimed.

To explain this 10 lines proof to Lean, we will cut it in several sublemmas.
